# userjs
collection of userjs files for various sites

The various third party sites for sharing these tend to be sketchy or
poorly maintained. I'm putting mine up here to share with others.

Anyone is welcome to use them or contribute changes.

There are multiple extensions that work with these files. I recommend
and use [Greasemonkey](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey)
with Firefox. Though all of them have had bugs intermittently since 
the Quantum engine update, it is currently the most reliable.

**Don't** use Tampermonkey. It is closed source and possibly spyware.
