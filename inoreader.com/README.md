# Natural Sort Order

When viewing posts on Inoreader, I'm normally in "unread only"
mode, in which case I want to view posts in chronological order.
But sometimes you want to view your archived posts, in which 
case you want the opposite order for two reasons:

1. You don't want to have to look back through thousands of 
posts to find an article you read a week ago.

2. Inoreader limits the posts you can see in "view all" mode
to the last month unless you're sorting newest to oldest.

So this script automatically switches the view order to match
whether you're in unread only mode or view all mode.
