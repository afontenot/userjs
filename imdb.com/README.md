# Hide producer credits by default

Most well-known directors also have producer credits, sometimes a lot
of them. When this happens, you have to scroll endlessly past all the
producer credits to see the director's credits, which is what you 
usually want to see. 

This script figures out when the producer credit is visible, and tries
to hide it for you and show the next set of credits automatically.
