# Chronological Tweets

Twitter is a terrible website. At least with this script,
you can view posts chronologically. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Only tested with "new" Twitter.

# Filter Prolific Retweeters

Some accounts are worth following, but they employ underpaid
interns to retweet anything someone says who agrees with them.

This script will block *only* the retweets from these accounts. Add
your own accounts (by display name) to the `banned_retweeters` list.
By default it just contains the account I follow that prompted the
creation of this script.

Expect this to break a lot, at least until I improve it or new Twitter
gets smoothed out.
