# Mastodon - Threaded Replies

Adds visual indentation to replies on Mastodon. Extremely useful
for large threads.

**Note:** it's not possible for a user script to match the URLs for all
Mastodon servers in existence. You will need to edit this script to match
the URL your server uses.

**Note:** Mastodon is currently trialing a "thread-line" implementation
that isn't directly compatible with this script. In my opinion, this
implementation is strictly inferior because it doesn't implement proper
threading, thus it doesn't solve the problem of decontextualized replies.
As a workaround for this, this script will revert the new Mastodon
changes if you install it.
